Profile: Every enterprise application has many environments.

        like: Dev | Test | Stage | Prod | UAT / Pre-Prod
		
Each environment requires a setting that is specific to them. For example, in DEV, we do not need to constantly check database consistency. 
Whereas in TEST and STAGE, we need to. These environments host specific configurations called Profiles

This is simple â€” properties files
We make properties files for each environment and set the profile in the application accordingly, so it will pick the respective properties file
