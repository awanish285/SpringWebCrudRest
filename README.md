Profile: Every enterprise application has many environments.

        like: Dev | Test | Stage | Prod | UAT / Pre-Prod
		
Each environment requires a setting that is specific to them. For example, in DEV, we do not need to constantly check database consistency. 
Whereas in TEST and STAGE, we need to. These environments host specific configurations called Profiles

This is simple â€” properties files
We make properties files for each environment and set the profile in the application accordingly, so it will pick the respective properties file

Enabling Actuator:

To enable Spring Boot actuator endpoints to your Spring Boot application, 
we need to add the Spring Boot Starter actuator dependency in our build configuration file.
Maven users can add the below dependency in your pom.xml file.

<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>


Key Features Offered by an Actuator:

Health check: You can use a health endpoint to check the status of your running application.

Monitoring and Management over HTTP/JMX: Actuator support HTTP endpoint as well as Java Management Extensions (JMX) to provide a standard mechanism to monitor and manage applications.

Logger: It provides a feature to view and update the logs level.

Spring Boot JPA is a Java specification for managing relational data in Java applications. 
It allows us to access and persist data between Java object/ class and relational database. 
JPA follows Object-Relation Mapping (ORM). It is a set of interfaces. 
It also provides a runtime EntityManager API for processing queries and transactions on the objects against the database. It uses a platform-independent object-oriented query language JPQL (Java Persistent Query Language).

In the context of persistence, it covers three areas:

The Java Persistence API
Object-Relational metadata
The API itself, defined in the persistence package
JPA is not a framework. 
It defines a concept that can be implemented by any framework.
